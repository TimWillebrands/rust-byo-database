# Build Your Own Database From Scratch: Rust Edition
This is a project to learn the basics of rust and databases by building a toy-database. I have no experience in either so don't expect magnificent code.
So far B-Trees have been really cool.

The book I use for this project is: https://build-your-own.org/database/
